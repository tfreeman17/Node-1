/*
Your assignment is to implement the following functionality:
	* remove a file
		"rm" <file name>
		> rm hello.txt
			entirely delete the file hello.txt

	* find and replace a word in the file
		"replace" <file to search> <word to replace> <replacement word>
		> replace hello.txt hello goodbye
			replace all instances of hello in hello.txt with goodbye
		> replace what.txt there their
			replace all instances of there in what.txt with their

	* find a line in a file
		"grep" <file name> <word to find>
		> grep hello.txt hello
			print out all of the lines in hello.txt that contain "hello"
		> grep what.txt there
			print out all of the lines in what.txt that contain "there"

	Bonus work:
		* Ask for confirmation before deleting a file
		* Don't let people delete files that are above the current working directory (i.e. disallow "../")
		* Have grep take a regular expression as the word to find
		* Create mkdir and rmdir
*/
